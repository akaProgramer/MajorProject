# Major Project

> Our Major Project for the final semester of BCA.

## Usage

To be able to run these programs, you need to have an up to date `Python3` version installed, **Python 3.9** is recommended.

To install required libraries, run -

```
pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```

**Note:** We've used pip as dependency and packaging tool, it should come with Python3 if you're on Windows, but in case it is not already installed on your system, kindly check [How to install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) guide to install it.
